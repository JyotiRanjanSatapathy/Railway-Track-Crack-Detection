# Railway-Track-Crack-Detection

1. The robot vehicle in this proposed solution is a simple bluetooth controlled robot
mounted with ultrasonic sensors and GPS module that is powered by means of a
LIPO battery..
2. When the vehicle is powered on it moves along the model track.The vehicle
movement is controlled by Bluetooth module that controls the direction of rotation of
DC motors which in turn is responsible for providing driving torque to the wheels of
the vehicle.For driving the DC motors,L298N motor driver is used which allows
speed and direction control of DC motors.
3. .Two ultrasonic sensors are present on two sides of the vehicle. The working of the
ultrasonic sensor is same as that of a sonar used in ships. The work of ultrasonic
sensors is to detect cracks/flaws in railtrack and the principle behind this is the
measurement of time taken for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic waves.
